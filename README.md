# Molecule-Maker
Allows you to quickly draw organic molecules in Chem Draw, by coping and pasting the Smiles. The program will also  provide with with Molecular weight and Formula for the molecule of your choosing. 

**Instructions:**
1) Insert the molecule's name, either the formal or common name will work.
2) If you want to draw the molecule into ChemDraw simply copy and paste the smiles and it'll work
   
**Notes:**
1. SMILES only works for ORGANIC molecules, therefore, no inorganic molecules that can be drawn, but you can draw the ligands and attach them to the metal on your own.
2. If you are looking for additional properties of the molecule you can insert it into line 8. For example, if you wanted to add the number of Hbond acceptors, you would do something like this:
'property/CanonicalSMILES,MolecularWeight,MolecularFormula,HbondAcceptorCount'
Okay, that should be everything, GLHF!
